## Title of the Project
A Real-Time Behavioral Analysis and Wellness Recommendations 


## About
<!--Detailed Description about the project-->
Human Activity Recognition (HAR) plays a pivotal role in accurately interpreting human actions and emotions, with significant applications in medical and healthcare domains. This project aims to leverage cutting-edge deep learning techniques to enhance patient care through real-time analysis of human behavior and mood. By utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, the project provides an innovative solution for monitoring and analyzing emotional of the people. The combination of CNNs and LSTMs enables the creation of a real-time system capable of detecting and analyzing both emotional and physical states of an individual. This system can track changes in mood, identify signs of distress, and provide immediate recommendations or alerts to healthcare providers for timely intervention.

## Features
